## Notes for Module 2 | Lesson 3 

To run locally you'll need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine, and the [NPM Package "http-server"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) installed globally:
```bash 
$ npm install -g http-server 
```
This is a good package to have in general.
